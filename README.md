# Applied-Linear-Models-Project
From a Shark Tank Dataset, we analyzed whether a proposal would get a ‘deal’ or not based on the category of the product/service, the location of the company, the amount of stake asked for, the amount of money asked for, the company valuation, and the episode number. For the analysis, we used R to complete the following steps:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Finding Strength of Correlation between Variables
- Building Multiple Linear Regression Model
- Anonva Fitting
- Drafting a Conclusion Analyzing the Data
